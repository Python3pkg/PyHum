.. pyhum.read:

pyhum.read module
======================

    Read a .DAT and associated set of .SON files recorded by a Humminbird(R)
    instrument. 
    
    Parse the data into a set of memory mapped files that will
    subsequently be used by the other functions of the PyHum module. 
    
    Export time-series data and metadata in other formats. 
    
    Create a kml file for visualising boat track

Syntax
----------

You call the function like this::

  [] = PyHum.read(humfile, sonpath, cs2cs_args, c, draft, doplot, t, f, bedpick, flip_lr, chunksize)

Parameters
------------

    humfile : str
       path to the .DAT file
    sonpath : str
       path where the *.SON files are
    cs2cs_args : int, *optional* [Default="epsg:26949"]
       arguments to create coordinates in a projected coordinate system
       this argument gets given to pyproj to turn wgs84 (lat/lon) coordinates
       into any projection supported by the proj.4 libraries
    c : float, *optional* [Default=1450.0]
       speed of sound in water (m/s). Defaults to a value of freshwater
    draft : float, *optional* [Default=0]
       draft from water surface to transducer face (m)
    doplot : float, *optional* [Default=1]
       if 1, plots will be made
    t : float, *optional* [Default=0.108]
       length of transducer array (m).
       Default value is that of the 998 series Humminbird(R)
    f : float, *optional* [Default=455]
       frequency of sidescan transducer in kHz
    bedpick : int, *optional* [Default=1]
       if 1, bedpicking with be carried out automatically
       if 0, user will be prompted to pick the bed location on screen
    flip_lr : int, *optional* [Default=0]
       if 1, port and starboard scans will be flipped
       (for situations where the transducer is flipped 180 degrees)
    chunksize : int, *optional* [Default=0]
       if not 0, the data will be parsed into 'chunks' of data which
       are 'chunksize' scans long. A scan is a ping, or the simultaneous
       acquisition of a port and starboard scan. A typical value to keep 
       data chunks a manageable (small) size is 10,000 - 50,000
    model: int, *optional* [Default=998]
       A 3 or 4 number code indicating the model number 
       Examples: 998, 997, 1198, 1199
